- 👋 Hi, I’m @jessterryberry, a Computer Programming Student at Niagara College.
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# (.NetCore/.Net Framework/MVC) and have an interest in learning Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much right now, as I am still learning! If you have any small projects that are JavaScript or C#, I may be interested.
- 📫 How to reach me - on twitter. You should be able to find me by looking for the same name :)
